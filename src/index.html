		<h2>More information</h2>

		<h3>When shall I come?</h3>
		<p>Our next gathering will be on Monday, 25th March 2019. We generally kick things off between 6 and 6.30pm. <a href="https://billetto.co.uk/e/diacritics-club-march-tickets-344932" target="_blank">Tickets</a>.</p>

		<h3>Where do I go?</h3>
		<p>We’ll meet at <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com" target="_blank">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> (34-35 Great Sutton St, EC1V 0DX), near Farringdon/Barbican.</p>

		<h3>Do I need a ticket?</h3>
		<p>The club is open to everyone and you can just show up. However, we recommend you get a ticket if you want to make sure you have a seat.</p>

		<h3>How do I get one?</h3>
		<p>Become a club member using the form above to be informed as soon as the tickets are released.</p> 

		<h3>Is it free?</h3>
		<p>Yes! Joining is free, tickets are free, and there’s nothing to pay at the door either. You just pay for your own drinks and food at the bar.</p>

		<h3>Is this for me?</h3>
		<p>If you know what a diacritic is, chances are you’re going to enjoy the evening. If you don’t, well you’re in for a treat&thinsp;–&thinsp;it’ll be a great opportunity to learn.</p>
		<p>If you’re working with type, like it, or want to get into it, whether it’s designing it or using it, you’ll be right at home.</p>
		<p>Essentially, if you like the idea of chatting with typographers, type designers, web developers, book designers, technologists, text designers, about fonts&thinsp;—&thinsp;then this is definitely for you. It's a great way to stay in touch with the community and keep up with what's happening in the type world.</p>

		<h3>What can I expect?</h3>
		<p>Opinionated chats about the use and misuse of fonts, feedback on material brought by members of the club and occasionally we might also have a presentation by a special guest. All of that in the usual comfortable atmosphere of a British pub.</p>
		<p>It’s like having a drink with your friends, except they actually listen to you when you suddenly get passionate about fonts.</p>

		<h3>Should I bring anything?</h3>
		<p>Anyone can bring type specimens, books or work in progress but also we usually sketch, draw and sometimes linocut throughout the evening.</p> 
		<p>The group generally discusses the latest news in type, branding and design, so we recommend bringing some conversation material, but even that is not required.</p>

		<h3>What’s required of me then?</h3>
		<p>The type world can be scary and unapproachable and to change that we need you need to be friendly and courteous.</p>
		<p>When talking about someone else’s work, please keep in mind that working with type can be very time consuming and takes a lot of effort. Try to explain why you think a certain way and provide constructive feedback or offer suggestions of improvements.</p>
		<p>We will <span class="red">not</span> tolerate any form of harassment.</p>
		
		<h3>I wish I could talk about fonts every day!</h3>
		<p>Well, you’re in luck because the community chats online regularly using <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>, a chat application that works in your browser, your phone and your desktop.</p>
