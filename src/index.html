		<p class="intro">The Diacritics Club is a London based meetup to talk type and typography. The club is an informal place for type enthusiasts across industries to gather, ask for advice and feedback, share a drink, and have a good time.</p>

		<h2>More information</h2>

		<h3>When shall I come?</h3>
		<p>Our next gathering will be on Wednesday, 26th September 2018. We generally kick things off between 6 and 6.30pm.</p>

		<h3>Where do I go?</h3>
		<p>We’ll meet at the <a href="http://shipandshovell.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ship & Shovell</a> (1-3 Craven Passage, WC2N 5PH), near Charing Cross Station. Climb the stairs, we should have a table booked there.</p>

		<h3>Do I need an invite?</h3>
		<p>No, you can just show up. Invites only help us track who’s coming for organisation purposes. Become a club member using the form above if you want to be kept up to date.</p> 

		<h3>Is it free?</h3>
		<p>Yes! Joining is free and there’s nothing to pay at the door either. You just pay for your own drinks and food at the bar.</p>

		<h3>Is this for me?</h3>
		<p>If you know what a diacritic is, chances are you’re going to enjoy the evening. If you don’t, well you’re in for a treat&thinsp;–&thinsp;it’ll be a great opportunity to learn.</p>
		<p>If you’re working with type, like it, or want to get into it, whether it’s designing it or using it, you’ll be right at home.</p>
		<p>Essentially, if you like the idea of chatting with typographers, type designers, web developers, book designers, technologists, text designers, about fonts&thinsp;—&thinsp;then this is definitely for you.</p>

		<h3>What can I expect?</h3>
		<p>Opinionated chats about the use and misuse of fonts, feedback on material brought by members of the club and occasionally we might also have a presentation by a special guest. All of that in the usual comfortable atmosphere of an English pub.</p>
		<p>It’s like having a drink with your friends, except they actually listen to you when you suddenly get passionate about fonts.</p>

		<h3>Should I bring anything?</h3>
		<p>If you like you can bring some of your work in progress to get some feedback. Members of the club delight in telling you what they think&thinsp;–&thinsp;it’s up to you to decide what to do with their opinion afterwards.</p>
		<p>The group usually discusses the latest news in type, branding and design, so we recommend bringing some conversation material, but even that is not required.</p>

		<h3>What’s required of me then?</h3>
		<p>The type world can be scary and unapproachable and to change that we need you need to be friendly and courteous.</p>
		<p>When talking about someone else’s work, please keep in mind that working with type can be very time consuming and takes a lot of effort. Try to explain why you think a certain way and provide constructive feedback or offer suggestions of improvements.</p>
		<p>We will <span class="red">not</span> tolerate any form of harassment.</p>
		
		<h3>I wish I could talk about fonts every day!</h3>
		<p>Well, you’re in luck because the community chats online regularly using <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a>, a chat application that works in your browser, your phone and your desktop.</p>
